              <strong>Description:</strong> These five laws govern existence, providing a framework for understanding reality and personal responsibility:<br>
              1. You exist.<br>
              2. The One is All, and the All are One.<br>
              3. What you put out is what you get back.<br>
              4. The only constant is change, except the first three laws.<br>
              5. Everything exists here and now.<br>
              <strong>Suggested Practice:</strong> Reflect on these laws and consider how they influence your perception of reality. Apply the law of "What you put out is what you get back" by embodying positivity.<br>
