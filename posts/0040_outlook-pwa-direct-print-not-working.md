# Print Button Not Working in Outlook PWA for PDF Attachments

## Issue Overview  
Many users have reported that clicking the **Print** button for PDF attachments in Outlook’s web app (PWA) does nothing or leads to an error (such as a blank page or a 404 Not Found) ([Outlook 365, when I try to print an email, it opens a blank webpage.](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/outlook-365-when-i-try-to-print-an-email-it-opens/eceb4f93-ee9b-4481-86c2-3f491967a6dd#:~:text=Outlook%20365%2C%20when%20I%20try,PDF%20and%20choose%20PRINT)) ([Outlook.com Print Button Does Not Work for ANY Attachment, PDF ...](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/outlookcom-print-button-does-not-work-for-any/373f4be5-dd78-49ac-804e-ac277a2cd008#:~:text=Outlook,How%20do%20I%20fix%20this)). This issue occurs when using Outlook via the browser (outlook.office.com) or the installed Progressive Web App. In these cases, the PDF preview opens, but the **Print** command fails to launch the print dialog or produces an error page. Microsoft has acknowledged a bug in Outlook on the web that prevents attachments from opening or printing correctly, and has indicated they are aware of the issue and working on it ([Cannot print a pdf attachment on hotmail's website.](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/cannot-print-a-pdf-attachment-on-hotmails-website/99cbc438-b669-4bfa-a27e-8b7c3d455ecc#:~:text=Cannot%20print%20a%20pdf%20attachment,and%20is%20working%20on%20it)). In short, it’s a known glitch with the Outlook Web App interface rather than a misconfiguration on your end.

## Possible Causes and Browser Factors  

- **Outlook Web App Bug:** The core cause appears to be a glitch in the Outlook Web application’s handling of attachment printing. It has been observed across multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera) ([Printing feature stopped working, Outlook on the Web. | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365/printing-feature-stopped-working-outlook-on-the-web/m-p/3902069#:~:text=Printing%20feature%20stopped%20working%2C%20Outlook,on%20the%20Web)), and even using a private/incognito window doesn’t help ([Printing feature stopped working, Outlook on the Web. | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365/printing-feature-stopped-working-outlook-on-the-web/m-p/3902069#:~:text=Aug%2016%2C%202023)), which suggests the problem lies with Outlook’s web code or service rather than local cache or settings alone. Essentially, the **Print** button’s action isn’t properly triggering the browser’s print function for the PDF.

- **PWA Service Worker Interference:** When Outlook is installed as a PWA, it utilizes service workers for offline capability and caching. There is evidence that the Office 365/Outlook service worker can interfere with opening attachments for printing. One community user found that **unregistering the Office365 service worker** in Chrome’s DevTools immediately fixed the PDF printing problem ([Printing PDFs in Chrome from Office 365 require unregistering the](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/printing-pdfs-in-chrome-from-office-365-require/5f97ef22-5fe3-4d93-ad2a-0166f4fa4537#:~:text=Printing%20PDFs%20in%20Chrome%20from,unregister%20the%20office365%20service%20worker)). The service worker may be caching the PDF or the print dialog in a way that fails to load when triggered, resulting in a blank page or no action. Removing or disabling the service worker forces the web app to fetch content directly from the server, avoiding the cached route that might be causing the error.

- **Edge Print Dialog Quirk:** In Microsoft Edge (including when running Outlook as an Edge PWA), the print dialog sometimes fails to appear at all – the window simply freezes at the point where the print options should come up ([Unable to print in Outlook Web App - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/unable-to-print-in-outlook-web-app/abc0601c-71a7-4b56-8441-2b80ba28ea1e#:~:text=Community%20answers,attempts%20to%20print%20in)). One forum post noted the freeze occurred only in Edge; when the user tried printing via Chrome, the process did not hang at that stage ([Unable to print in Outlook Web App - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/unable-to-print-in-outlook-web-app/abc0601c-71a7-4b56-8441-2b80ba28ea1e#:~:text=Community%20answers,attempts%20to%20print%20in)). This hints that Edge’s printing interface or a pop-up window may not be launching correctly in the PWA context. Edge has an **internal print preview** by default, and if that fails to initialize (or is blocked), nothing will happen. In contrast, Chrome’s print handling might behave slightly differently. This browser-specific behavior means the issue can be more pronounced in the Edge-installed PWA than in Chrome or other browsers.

- **Browser Extensions and Blockers:** Another factor that can cause the print button to malfunction is interference from browser extensions. For example, a user discovered that the **Grammarly** extension in Chrome was preventing the print function from working in Outlook Web; once Grammarly was turned off, printing started working again ([Unable to print in Outlook Web App - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/unable-to-print-in-outlook-web-app/abc0601c-71a7-4b56-8441-2b80ba28ea1e#:~:text=Community%20answers,Was)). Similarly, ad-blockers or script-blocking extensions could potentially stop the print dialog from opening (since the print button likely calls a JavaScript function to open the print window). In a PWA, extensions still apply because the app is essentially a browser window. If you have any content blockers, PDF viewer extensions, or anything that modifies web content, they could be injecting scripts or blocking pop-ups needed for printing.

- **Pop-up or Redirect Blocking:** The act of printing an attachment in Outlook Web might involve opening a new window or triggering a browser print dialog which some browsers treat like a pop-up. If your browser or PWA has strict settings, it might be blocking that action. Microsoft support forums have advised ensuring that JavaScript is enabled and that **pop-ups and redirects** are allowed for the Outlook site ([Website Print Buttons Not Working in Edge - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/website-print-buttons-not-working-in-edge/85259a12-e997-45ce-8c5f-81f22e3baca3#:~:text=Community%20answers,can%20also%20allow%20Insecure)). If pop-ups were blocked, you might click “Print” and nothing visible happens because the print preview window was suppressed. In a normal browser, you might see a notification about a blocked pop-up, but in a PWA (which has no standard address bar or notification area), it could be silently blocked. Therefore, it’s important to check the site permissions for outlook.office.com in your browser settings and make sure pop-ups are permitted.

- **Multiple-Account or Policy Scenarios:** In some cases, the issue might not be a bug but an intentional block due to how you’re accessing the mailbox or organizational policies:  
  - If you are using Outlook on the web to access **another mailbox (shared mailbox or another user’s mailbox)** via the “Open another mailbox” feature, there was a known issue where attachment previews would fail or show an empty page due to an authentication redirect. Microsoft identified this problem (causing an empty page with a URL starting with outlook.office365.com/owa/...) and fixed it in Exchange server updates ([Attachments can’t be downloaded or previewed from Outlook Web App - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/attachments-can-t-be-downloaded-or-previewed-from-outlook-web-app-16e926a2-f710-4e0d-5ae8-fc5d265ad20f#:~:text=Cause)). If you’re in an on-premises/hybrid Exchange environment, ensuring the server is up to date (Exchange 2016 CU19 / Exchange 2019 CU8 or newer) resolves that specific 302 redirect bug.  
  - If you’re on a work/school account, check if your organization has a **Conditional Access or browser access policy** that restricts downloads/printing on unmanaged devices. When such a policy is in effect, the web interface will usually display a banner or message like “Your organization doesn’t allow you to download, print, or sync using this device” ([Office 365 - Unable to Download, print, or sync when using Chrome or Firefox (but works in IE) | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft-365/office-365---unable-to-download-print-or-sync-when-using-chrome-or-firefox-but-w/287624#:~:text=My%20issue%20is%20that%20if,and%20I%20have%20full%20functionality)). In that case, the print button would be non-functional by design. Notably, these policies often affect certain browsers; for instance, one user reported Chrome and Firefox were blocked from downloading/printing due to policy, while using IE (or Edge in IE mode) bypassed it ([Office 365 - Unable to Download, print, or sync when using Chrome or Firefox (but works in IE) | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/discussions/microsoft-365/office-365---unable-to-download-print-or-sync-when-using-chrome-or-firefox-but-w/287624#:~:text=My%20issue%20is%20that%20if,and%20I%20have%20full%20functionality)). If you suspect this, you may need to use a managed device or the desktop Outlook client, or talk to your IT admin about the policy. (However, if you aren’t seeing a clear warning message, then it’s likely the print failure is due to the bug rather than a policy.)

## Workarounds and Potential Fixes  

Because this is a known issue with Outlook Web App, the true fix may ultimately come from Microsoft’s side. In the meantime, several workarounds and settings adjustments have been found to help users print PDF attachments successfully:

- **Use the PDF’s Context Menu to Print:** Instead of using Outlook’s print button, try right-clicking on the PDF attachment (either from the attachment list or within the PDF preview) and select **“Print”** from the context menu. This triggers the browser’s native print for the PDF file directly. Users have reported that while the regular print button redirected to a blank page, using the right-click > Print method worked to bring up the print dialog for the PDF ([Outlook 365, when I try to print an email, it opens a blank webpage.](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/outlook-365-when-i-try-to-print-an-email-it-opens/eceb4f93-ee9b-4481-86c2-3f491967a6dd#:~:text=Outlook%20365%2C%20when%20I%20try,PDF%20and%20choose%20PRINT)). It’s a simple workaround that bypasses whatever script Outlook is failing to execute.

- **Download and Print Outside PWA:** If printing directly in the PWA fails, you can click the **Download** button for the PDF attachment and open it in a desktop PDF reader (or even in a regular browser tab) to print. While this isn’t a fix for the PWA itself, it ensures you can get a hard copy of the attachment when needed. Essentially, you’re avoiding the Outlook Web interface for printing by using an external application. This was even suggested in Microsoft’s documentation – if the file type can’t be previewed/printed in Outlook Web, download it and print with a dedicated program ([Quick Print stops printing PDF attachments in Outlook Desktop](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/quick-print-stops-printing-pdf-attachments-in-outlook-desktop-512fdeb0-6a88-4e6c-9285-cf957290aad2#:~:text=Quick%20Print%20stops%20printing%20PDF,may%20get%20an%20error%20message)). It’s not ideal for workflow, but it’s a reliable fallback until the web issue is resolved.

- **Disable or Remove Conflicting Extensions:** As noted, extensions like Grammarly, ad blockers, or PDF tools can interfere with the print process. Try printing from Outlook Web with all extensions turned **off** (you can disable them individually or use an incognito window, which by default runs without most extensions). If printing works with extensions disabled, re-enable them one by one to identify the culprit. In one case, turning off Grammarly in Chrome immediately re-enabled printing in Outlook Web ([Unable to print in Outlook Web App - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/unable-to-print-in-outlook-web-app/abc0601c-71a7-4b56-8441-2b80ba28ea1e#:~:text=Community%20answers,Was)). If you find a specific extension is the cause, you might need to keep it disabled for Outlook’s site or find an alternative solution (for example, if a PDF extension is an issue, allow Outlook to use its built-in viewer instead of the extension). Whitelisting Outlook’s domain in privacy/ad-block extensions could also help if those were blocking a needed script.

- **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies:** Corrupted or outdated cached data in the browser can sometimes break web app functionalities. Clearing the cache and cookies for Outlook.office.com can force the web app to load fresh resources. Microsoft community moderators often suggest clearing the browser cache when web features act up ([Outlook.com prints blank page - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/outlookcom-prints-blank-page/14d8a182-5168-486a-83dd-a2dae8c07284#:~:text=Outlook.com%20prints%20blank%20page%20,If%20the%20issue)). After clearing cache/cookies, close the PWA/browser and reopen Outlook Web, then try to print the attachment again. Be aware this may log you out, so you’ll need to sign in again. Some users did report that clearing cache fixed the printing issue **temporarily** (it reoccurred after some time) ([Outlook webmail attachment previews failing to open in Edge](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/outlook-webmail-attachment-previews-failing-to/7ab5b3c8-9b9d-4710-83a9-95f57e51e2f8#:~:text=Edge%20answers,temporarily%20fixes%20the%20problem)), but it’s a worthwhile step to try as it’s easy to do. If the problem returns, it might be due to the service worker caching mentioned earlier.

- **Verify Pop-up/Redirect Permissions:** Ensure that your browser is not blocking the print dialog or opening of a new window. In Chrome, for instance, after clicking Print you should see either the print preview or a system dialog – if not, a subtle blocked pop-up icon might appear in the address bar. Since in PWA mode you might not notice it, go to Chrome’s settings for the Outlook site: open a normal Chrome tab to **outlook.office.com**, click the padlock 🔒 icon > **Site settings**, and find the **Pop-ups and redirects** setting. Set it to **Allow** for Outlook (and make sure JavaScript is allowed as well, which it is by default ([Website Print Buttons Not Working in Edge - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/website-print-buttons-not-working-in-edge/85259a12-e997-45ce-8c5f-81f22e3baca3#:~:text=Community%20answers,can%20also%20allow%20Insecure))】. In Edge, you can do similarly via Settings > Cookies and site permissions > Pop-ups and redirects (add outlook.office.com to allowed list). Once pop-ups are allowed, the print button’s attempt to open the print window should go through if that was the blocker. After changing this, try the print function again in the PWA.

- **Try a Different Browser or Installation Method:** As a troubleshooting step, see if the issue is specific to the environment. If you’re currently using Outlook as a PWA in Edge, try using it in Chrome (either as a normal website or install it as a Chrome PWA) and test printing there – or vice versa. Some people have found that one browser handled the print action better than the other. For example, if Edge PWA is freezing when printing, Chrome’s PWA or web might work (or at least give a different error ([Unable to print in Outlook Web App - Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/unable-to-print-in-outlook-web-app/abc0601c-71a7-4b56-8441-2b80ba28ea1e#:~:text=Community%20answers,attempts%20to%20print%20in))】. Conversely, if Chrome was giving a 404 error page, trying Edge might yield a working print dialog. Switching browsers isn’t a permanent solution, but it can help you get the document printed and also confirm if the problem is browser-specific. If one works consistently, you might use that as a temporary way to print until a fix lands for your preferred browser.

- **Remove or Refresh the Service Worker (Advanced):** If you suspect the Outlook PWA’s service worker is causing the hangup (as one answer suggest ([Printing PDFs in Chrome from Office 365 require unregistering the](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/printing-pdfs-in-chrome-from-office-365-require/5f97ef22-5fe3-4d93-ad2a-0166f4fa4537#:~:text=Printing%20PDFs%20in%20Chrome%20from,unregister%20the%20office365%20service%20worker))】), you can manually unregister it. In Chrome: open the Outlook web app, press **F12** to open Developer Tools, go to the **Application** tab, find **Service Workers** for outlook.office.com, and click “Unregister” for the active service worker. In Edge, you can do similar via DevTools. Once the service worker is unregistered, refresh the page. This forces Outlook Web to load without the offline cache helper in place. Users have reported that doing this allowed them to print PDFs where previously it was failin ([Printing PDFs in Chrome from Office 365 require unregistering the](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/printing-pdfs-in-chrome-from-office-365-require/5f97ef22-5fe3-4d93-ad2a-0166f4fa4537#:~:text=Printing%20PDFs%20in%20Chrome%20from,unregister%20the%20office365%20service%20worker))】. Keep in mind, the service worker may re-register on the next login or refresh (since Outlook will detect its absence and install it again for offline functionality). This technique is mainly a diagnostic workaround; it tells you if the service worker was part of the problem. If printing works after removal but then breaks again later, you might periodically clear the service worker or disable Outlook’s PWA offline mode until an official fix is out.

- **Edge-Specific Tweak – Use System Print Dialog:** If you are using Edge and the print dialog never appears (Edge seems to hang), consider toggling Edge’s print dialog setting. Edge Chromium has a flag or setting to use the **System Print Dialog** instead of its own preview. Some enterprise users noted that switching to the system dialog bypassed the issue where Edge would hang on printin ([Edge hangs when printing : r/MicrosoftEdge - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge/comments/12iuz9i/edge_hangs_when_printing/#:~:text=Edge%20hangs%20when%20printing%20%3A,We))】. To try this, type `edge://flags` in the Edge address bar and search for “Enable system print dialog”. Enable that flag, restart the browser, and see if printing from the Outlook PWA behaves better. If the flag isn’t available (or if you prefer not to use flags), check with your IT admin if a group policy is forcing a particular print dialog. Using the alternate print path might avoid the bug. (On the flip side, if you *are* using the system dialog and it’s not working, try disabling that to use Edge’s built-in preview – essentially, test both modes to see if one succeeds.)

- **Keep Outlook Web Updated:** Because Microsoft has acknowledged the issue, watch for any updates. Outlook on the web is updated by Microsoft on the server side, so there’s no version to manually update on your end, but it’s good practice to **reload** the PWA periodically. Fully close the Outlook PWA and reopen it (or press Ctrl+F5 in the web version) to ensure you’re running the latest web code. If your mailbox is on Exchange Online, any fix Microsoft deploys will eventually propagate to your account. (For reference, similar attachment printing issues in on-prem Exchange OWA were fixed by specific cumulative update ([Attachments can’t be downloaded or previewed from Outlook Web App - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/attachments-can-t-be-downloaded-or-previewed-from-outlook-web-app-16e926a2-f710-4e0d-5ae8-fc5d265ad20f#:~:text=Resolution))】 – in the cloud, the fix would come as a service update.) If the issue persists over a long period, consider checking Microsoft’s Office 365 service status or forums for any notices about Outlook Web printing bugs.

- **Use Desktop Outlook as a Last Resort:** While not a solution for the PWA, remember that you can always fall back to the Outlook desktop client (if you have it) to print attachments. Save the email or attachment and print from the desktop app. The desktop Outlook has a feature called **Quick Print** for attachments, which automatically prints them via the default PDF viewer/printe ([404 Error code when selecting to print attachment](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/404-error-code-when-selecting-to-print-attachment/73d0e05c-a605-42a9-982b-32b533545690#:~:text=Delete%20Outlook%20temporary%20files,by%20deleting%20temporary%20Outlook%20files))】. (Quick Print in Outlook desktop had its own known issue with PDFs in the past, but Microsoft has documented a fix for that separatel ([Quick Print stops printing PDF attachments in Outlook Desktop](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/quick-print-stops-printing-pdf-attachments-in-outlook-desktop-512fdeb0-6a88-4e6c-9285-cf957290aad2#:~:text=Quick%20Print%20stops%20printing%20PDF,may%20get%20an%20error%20message))】.) If you frequently need to print attachments and the web app is unreliable, using the full Outlook client or even a third-party mail client might be a temporary workaround. Of course, this doesn’t fix the PWA’s print button, but it ensures important PDFs can be printed when you need them.

## Conclusion  
In summary, the non-functional print button for PDF attachments in the Outlook Web App (PWA) is a **known issue** that has frustrated many users. It’s not caused by user error, but rather by how the Outlook web interface handles (or fails to handle) the print action for attachments. Factors like service worker caching, browser print dialog behaviors, or extensions can exacerbate the problem. Microsoft is aware of the bug ([Cannot print a pdf attachment on hotmail's website.](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/cannot-print-a-pdf-attachment-on-hotmails-website/99cbc438-b669-4bfa-a27e-8b7c3d455ecc#:~:text=Cannot%20print%20a%20pdf%20attachment,and%20is%20working%20on%20it))】, so we can hope for a permanent fix in the near future. Until then, the best approach is to use the workarounds above – printing via context menu, adjusting browser settings, or using alternate methods – to get your PDFs printed. By trying those solutions, you should be able to work around the PWA’s limitations and continue your workflow with minimal disruption. Good luck, and keep an eye on updates from Microsoft for a more permanent resolution to this Outlook Web printing hiccup!
