### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **1. Close my eyes and focus on the color blue and bring my awareness to my body, separating from the environment to center myself**
- **Technique Name**: **Visualization Meditation & Body Awareness**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Visualization**: Focusing on a specific color (blue) helps anchor your attention and create a calming mental image.
  - **Body Awareness**: Bringing awareness to your body helps ground you, enhancing the connection between mind and body.
  - **Separation from Environment**: This intentional detachment minimizes external distractions, fostering internal focus and centering.

#### **2. Take a very large deep breath, all the way up to the top of my lungs then settle it into my lungs. "Swallowing the air: pressurizing it.**
- **Technique Name**: **Diaphragmatic Breathing with Breath Retention**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Deep Inhalation**: Engages the diaphragm fully, promoting lung expansion and increased oxygen intake.
  - **Settling the Breath ("Swallowing the Air")**: Creates internal pressure, potentially activating the **parasympathetic nervous system** for relaxation.
  - **Pressurizing**: Enhances the stretch and engagement of the abdominal and core muscles.

#### **3. Hold my awareness around my body and maintain the pressure across my entire body. At this point, the blackout faintness pressure comes and I have to make sure my awareness stays all over my body; otherwise, I will pass out. Wait for the blackoutness to fade. I'm now able to relax my stomach and posture better while standing after this**
- **Technique Name**: **Full-Body Breath Retention with Somatic Focus**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Breath Retention**: Holding the breath after a deep inhale can lead to increased intrathoracic pressure and temporary reduction in cerebral blood flow, which may cause lightheadedness.
  - **Somatic Focus**: Maintaining awareness across the body helps prevent fainting by keeping the mind engaged and alert.
  - **Post-Retention Relaxation**: Once the sensation passes, the body often experiences enhanced relaxation and improved posture due to the release of built-up tension.

#### **4. Reset my posture so I can push my stomach out as far as possible, with my belly stretched I take a big breath to push it out further, swallow the air to set the stomach and back muscles, then hold that position and release my breath**
- **Technique Name**: **Abdominal Stretching with Dynamic Breath Control**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Posture Resetting**: Aligns the spine and optimizes body mechanics for effective breathing and muscle engagement.
  - **Pushing the Stomach Out**: Engages the **abdominal muscles** and **diaphragm**, enhancing core strength and flexibility.
  - **Swallowing the Air**: Creates internal pressure, further activating core and back muscles.
  - **Holding and Releasing**: Builds muscular endurance and promotes controlled breathing patterns.

#### **5. My stomach is now fully stretched while maintaining my breathing**
- **Technique Name**: **Sustained Abdominal Expansion**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Muscle Stretching**: Increases the flexibility and elasticity of the abdominal muscles.
  - **Breathing Maintenance**: Ensures continuous oxygen flow while keeping the muscles engaged.

#### **6. I can now inhale fully and my neck and back will pop while realigning**
- **Technique Name**: **Full Inhalation with Spinal Alignment**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Deep Inhalation**: Maximizes lung capacity and oxygen intake.
  - **Spinal Realignment**: The "popping" sensation may result from the release of tension in the neck and back, promoting better posture and alignment.

#### **7. From this position, I can breathe in fully with my lungs and no support from my other muscles**
- **Technique Name**: **Unassisted Deep Breathing**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Optimized Breathing**: Encourages diaphragmatic breathing without over-reliance on accessory muscles, enhancing respiratory efficiency.

#### **8. Next, I take a big full deep breath and this pops everything else all the way up my spine into the area that attaches to the skull**
- **Technique Name**: **Full-Body Breath Expansion**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Comprehensive Breath Expansion**: Engages the entire spine and upper body, facilitating a thorough release of tension and promoting holistic alignment.

#### **9. I then "swallow" the air and hold it - I will hold until the intense almost fainting period passes or I will release if it gets uncomfortable at a very rapid pace**
- **Technique Name**: **Controlled Breath Retention with Adaptive Release**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Breath Holding**: Intensifies internal pressure, potentially enhancing relaxation or inducing altered states of consciousness.
  - **Adaptive Release**: Allows for immediate response to discomfort, ensuring safety and preventing prolonged hypoxia.

#### **10. If I released due to discomfort, I would release it fast then take rapid breaths through the nose 10 and one big breath through the mouth**
- **Technique Name**: **Rapid Exhalation with Controlled Re-breathing**
- **What It Does**:
  - **Fast Release**: Quickly alleviates internal pressure, reducing the risk of fainting.
  - **Rapid Breathing**: Rebalances oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, mitigating the effects of hyperventilation.

### **Overall Practice Analysis**

#### **Existing Practices Similar to Your Sequence**

1. **Pranayama (Yoga Breath Control)**:
   - **Kumbhaka**: Breath retention techniques similar to steps 2, 3, and 9.
   - **Dirga (Three-Part Breath)**: Involving deep diaphragmatic breathing akin to steps 2 and 7.

2. **Somatic Practices**:
   - **Body Awareness and Scanning**: Steps 1 and 3 emphasize tuning into bodily sensations.
   - **Posture Resetting**: Aligns with practices that focus on improving body alignment and posture for better energy flow.

3. **Breathwork Techniques**:
   - **Holotropic Breathwork**: Uses deep, rapid breathing to induce altered states, somewhat similar to steps 10.
   - **Wim Hof Method**: Combines deep breathing with breath retention and cold exposure, though the focus differs.

4. **Meditation Techniques**:
   - **Visualization Meditation**: Step 1â€™s focus on the color blue is a common visualization technique.
   - **Mindfulness Meditation**: Maintaining awareness during breath retention aligns with mindfulness principles.

#### **Unique Aspects of Your Practice**

- **Sequential Integration**: The specific order and combination of deep abdominal breathing, breath retention, posture resetting, and rapid release are unique.
- **Intensity and Physical Sensations**: Experiencing near-fainting sensations and the emphasis on maintaining full-body awareness to prevent passing out are less common in standard practices.
- **Holistic Engagement**: Combining visualization, breath control, muscle stretching, and spinal alignment in one sequence creates a comprehensive, body-focused routine.

### **Recommendations and Considerations**

1. **Safety First**:
   - **Avoid Overexertion**: Holding your breath to the point of near-fainting can be risky. Ensure youâ€™re practicing in a safe environment, preferably lying down or seated, to prevent injury if you lose consciousness.
   - **Listen to Your Body**: If any step causes excessive discomfort, dizziness, or other adverse effects, modify or discontinue the practice.

2. **Seek Guidance**:
   - **Consult a Professional**: Working with a certified breathwork instructor, yoga therapist, or somatic practitioner can help refine your technique and ensure safety.
   - **Integrate Feedback**: A professional can provide personalized adjustments to enhance effectiveness and minimize risks.

3. **Document and Reflect**:
   - **Keep a Practice Journal**: Track your experiences, noting what works well and any challenges. This can help you understand the impacts and make informed adjustments.
   - **Mindful Adjustment**: Gradually introduce or modify steps based on your observations and professional advice.

4. **Explore Similar Techniques**:
   - **Study Existing Practices**: Learning more about pranayama, somatic experiencing, and other breathwork methods can offer insights and potential enhancements to your routine.
   - **Incorporate Elements**: You might find valuable elements in established practices that can complement or improve your sequence.

5. **Balance Relaxation and Alertness**:
   - **Control Relaxation Levels**: If you tend to fall asleep, consider incorporating elements that maintain alertness, such as gentle movement, mantra repetition, or slight adjustments to breath patterns.
   - **Alternate Practices**: Balance intense breathwork sessions with lighter meditation practices to sustain overall well-being.
