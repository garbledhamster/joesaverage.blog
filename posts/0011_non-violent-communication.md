        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <strong>Purpose:</strong> Describe the situation without judgment or evaluation.<br>
              <strong>Typical Sensations:</strong> Neutrality, calmness, a sense of clarity.<br>
              <strong>Activation:</strong> Focus on the facts of the event as if reporting from a neutral standpoint. Avoid exaggerations or interpretations.<br>
              <strong>Deactivation:</strong> Pause and notice if judgment or blame enters, returning to observable facts.<br>
              <strong>Example:</strong> "I noticed that you didnâ€™t respond to my message until the next day."<br>
              <strong>Reminder:</strong> Keep observations specific to avoid defensiveness and focus on what happened, not interpretations.

              <strong>Purpose:</strong> Share your genuine emotions without blame.<br>

              <strong>Activation:</strong> Identify and name the true feeling, focusing on emotions rather than thoughts (e.g., â€œI feel disappointedâ€ rather than â€œI feel you donâ€™t careâ€).<br>
              <strong>Deactivation:</strong> Breathe and reframe if thoughts of blame arise, staying centered on the feeling itself.<br>
              <strong>Example:</strong> "I feel disappointed when I donâ€™t hear back from you quickly."<br>
              <strong>Reminder:</strong> Use â€œIâ€ statements and focus on genuine feelings rather than judgments or assumptions.

              <strong>Example:</strong> "I have a need for timely communication so I feel connected and informed."<br>
              <strong>Reminder:</strong> Focus on universal needs rather than specific solutions or demands.
